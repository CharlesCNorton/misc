*At the brink of the Sammath Naur they stood, where the vapours of Orodruin curled and the hot breath of the mountain beat like a slow bellows.*

Isildur, son of Elendil, held the Ring aloft; and it shone pale and perilous, as if it had a light of its own, cold against the red gloom. Grief was upon him, and pride, and weariness past telling.

Elrond spoke, courteous yet stern. "Lord Isildur, we are come to the end that was purposed ere ever swords were drawn. The Ruling Ring must be unmade. Cast it into the Fire, and let the Shadow pass."

Isildur's hand tightened. "It is the price of blood," he said, "for my father and my brother. A token of victory; a ransom for sorrow."

Círdan stood near, grey-clad and grave, and his glance was steady as winter light. Elrond answered: "Not victory, but bondage, if it be kept. We are not lords of ourselves only, for the doom of many hangs upon this hour."

Then they were silent for a little space, and the mountain laboured beneath their feet. The Ring flickered, and it seemed that a will peered from it, keen and perilous, searching for any heart that would open. Pity stirred in Elrond, and sorrow for the House of Elendil; yet pity is not folly, and sorrow not license. He stepped forward.

"No blade is drawn here," he said softly. "No shame is meant. But this work must be ended."

He set his left hand upon Isildur's shoulder, firm, not harsh, and with his right he took the king's wrist. Isildur started, and pride flared in him; but Elrond's hold was strong as living root, and there was no wrath in it. Círdan moved then, swift and sure. With the folded edge of his mantle he touched the Ring, for it seemed hot with an unwholesome fire, and he pressed at the knuckle with a craftsman's care, as one who will not let a foul thing cling. The gold writhed upon the flesh; there came a thin sound, like a far cry borne on wind; and the Ring slipped free.

"Now," said Elrond.

Círdan, who had long kept the West in his heart, turned and, without flourish or delay, cast the Ring into the red gulf.

There was no clang nor splash, only a sudden drawing-in of breath, as if the mountain itself hearkened. A deeper glow leapt upward; the vapours twisted, and for a moment all light seemed to bend downward into the chasm. Then the heat flowed out in a long sigh, and the fierce whispering of the Fire was changed.

Isildur stood as one released from a heavy mail. He looked on his hand, bare now, and on the gulf where the light had swallowed the gold. His face was white, and age and wisdom seemed to come upon him together. "I would have kept it," he said at last, his voice low. "I deemed I had right."

Elrond bowed his head. "Many rights were thine, Isildur Elendil's Heir; but one duty was above them. Be not ashamed. A dark net was cast upon us all."

Círdan drew his mantle close and gazed eastward. "The air is changed," he murmured. "The great will is broken. Long shall the Free Peoples draw breath."

Far below, horns answered, and the hosts upon the plain lifted their eyes; for a shadow that had lain upon their hearts was lightened, and the day seemed larger. Elrond loosed his gentle hold and stood beside the King. Together they turned from the brink, and the Fire behind them called no more.
